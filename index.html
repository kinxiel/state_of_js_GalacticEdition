    <h1>State of JS: Galactic Edition</h1>
    <div class="explanation">
      <p>
        In my poor attempt to mimic the design ambiance of the State of JS 2018, in
        this alternative world, web technologies are represented by planets
        rotating around a main theme (<span>Front-End, Back-End, Data, Flavor, Testing</span>). 
        <ul>
          <li>The <span>size</span> of the planet
            represents the total number of users</li>
          <li>The <span>period/speed</span> of the planet represents the amount of interest in the technology</li>
          <li>For perspective, the <span>orbits</span> represent the initial release of the technology (or at least my best estimate of it)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "explanation">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For <span>Front-End Frameworks</span>, we can see that there is a slight correlation between interest and newness. We can see that although <span>React</span> has a large user base and steady interest, <span>Vue</span> is gaining steam quite rapidly.</li>
          <li>The situation in <span>Back-End Frameworks</span> is quite unique. Although, <span>Express</span> is already 8 years old, it still garners a lot of interest from developers.</li>
          <li>For some reason most of the tech in the <span>Data Layer</span> section more or less started around the same time; fierce competition?</li>
          <li>For newer developers aiming to become <span>full stack developers</span>, the size of the planets may serve as a useful guide. Bigger planets (more users) can indicate that the technology is mature and that resources are available. <span>[React, Express, Redux, ES6, TypeScript, Jest]</span> (don't know if that combination makes sense...)</li>
          <li>For people who want to get ahead of the trend, you might want to look at the planets with the most momentum. <span>[Vue, Next.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, Jest]</span></li>
        </ul>
